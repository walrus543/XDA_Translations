## Translators: Developers need you.
1. Be part of the project by contacting [gaich](https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=4563466) on XDA. Send him a PM and he will add you to this index of **recognized translators**. Thank you!
Tell him the language(s) you can translate apps into. Don't hesitate if there is already a translator for your language, it's better to have more than one for each language.
2. Verify his entry and subscribe to the XDA thread and this Github repository to get the latest news and app translate requests.
3. If there is a request for translating an app, do it. If you think you can improve an existing translation, dive into its discussion.  

***

## How does this repository work?
Everybody creates pull requests.  
Developers to submit their apps and request modifications to existing apps. Translators to tell devs that one or more language(s) are completed.  
There are 3 branches:  
* `new_apps`: new apps which require many translations in many languages.  
* `ongoing_translations`: apps where strings are translated (almost) everywhere. Improvements are appreciated.  
* `discontinued`: don't waste your time. Those apps are no longer developed.
